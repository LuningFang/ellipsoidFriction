Each thread corresponds to each contact

Simulate an ellipsoid dropping on three other ellipsoids that are fixed (ground with curved surface)

Friction force computation to be packed in one function, use inline or macro instead of function calls

Use double for everything (time step dt use float)

Create a lookup table for friction model parameters (mu_s, mu_k, K_sl, K_r, K_sp, D_sl, D_r, D_sp) what being passed on are integers (type 1, 2, 3, â€¦) for handling different materials.

 Quaternions are used as inputs. Rotation matrix should never be computed, instead A=E*G^T, when A*s is needed, then do E*(G^T * s) and expand the entries
